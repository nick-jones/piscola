# piscola

Quick port of [pisco](https://github.com/nick-jones/pisco) to Go. This offers in-memory wildcarded and time sorted
lookup (and carries various bits of legacy baggage from the C++ version for compatibility reasons). Not intended for
general use, this is simply to replace an instance of `pisco` used in a long running personal project.
